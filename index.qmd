title: "`pharmaverse` examples"
---

The true beauty of pharmaverse (and open source in general) is when efforts from
various different developers come together to complement each other as a whole
greater than the sum of the individual parts. By design in R, no single package
will ever completely cover all your needs, but by piecing them together we can
make complex tasks increasingly simple.

This book contains end-to-end examples of using pharmaverse packages together to
achieve common clinical reporting analyses, such as SDTM, ADaM and Tables/Listings/Graphs.
The examples use consistent source test raw datasets from `{pharmaverseraw}`, 
SDTMs and ADaMs from `{pharmaversesdtm}` and `{pharmaverseadam}` respectively.

We'll endeavour to include a selection of examples here over time, e.g. to help
users when trying out the packages for PK/PD or Therapeutic Area specific
(such as Oncology or Vaccines) analyses.

Note that this examples book should only be used to show how collections of
packages can be used in conjunction - more thorough examples of individual
package usages would always be covered in the package site vignettes and no
need to repeat here.

## Running the examples

### Posit Cloud
Each example can be explored via a live and interactive Posit Cloud environment
(preconfigured with all required package installations).
Click here: ["Launch Posit Cloud"](https://posit.cloud/content/7279124) to
try out any of the examples code.
You can do this by clicking File: Open File: and then choosing whichever example script,
e.g. `adam/adsl.R`. 
Feel free to try out customizing any of the examples to better fit any of
your own internal clinical reporting workflows!

### Locally
To run examples locally, download the [repository](https://github.com/pharmaverse/examples) and run the following in the R console inside the project folder to install dependencies

```r
if(!require(pak)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}
pak::pak()
```
*Note: the R scripts are generated from `.qmd` files automatically using [`knitr::purl`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html).*
