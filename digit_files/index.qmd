### PowerPoint Presentations

- **[Auto Slider](autoslider.qmd)** - Create automated PowerPoint presentations with clinical trial outputs. This example demonstrates how to programmatically generate slides containing tables, figures, and analysis results, streamlining the creation of study presentations and data review meetings.

## Use Cases

These document generation capabilities are valuable for:

- Clinical study reports (CSRs)
- Statistical analysis plans (SAPs)
- Data review meetings
- Regulatory submission documents
- Study team presentations
- Internal stakeholder communications

## Getting Started

Each example demonstrates:

- Setting up document templates
- Populating documents with analysis results
