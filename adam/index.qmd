## Overview

This section provides end-to-end examples for creating Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets using pharmaverse packages. ADaM is a CDISC standard designed to facilitate efficient generation, replication, and review of clinical trial statistical analyses.

The examples demonstrate how to leverage multiple pharmaverse packages together, including `{admiral}`, `{metacore}`, `{metatools}`, and `{xportr}`, to build analysis-ready datasets from SDTM data.

All examples use SDTM datasets from `{pharmaversesdtm}` as input, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

## Examples

### Subject-Level Analysis Dataset (`ADSL`)

-   **[ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)](adsl.qmd)** - Create the foundational subject-level dataset containing demographic, treatment, and study participation information.

## Start Here
`ADSL` is the foundation for most other ADaM datasets. We recommend starting with this example if you're new to ADaM development with pharmaverse packages. `ADSL` contains one record per subject and serves as the basis for merging subject-level variables into other ADaM datasets.

### Basic Data Structure (BDS) Analysis Datasets

BDS datasets follow a standard structure with one observation per subject per analysis parameter per analysis timepoint. These are commonly used for efficacy and safety analyses.

-   **[`ADVS` (Vital Signs Analysis)](advs.qmd)** - Generate vital signs analysis dataset with baseline and change from baseline calculations.
-   **[`ADRS` (Response Analysis)](adrs.qmd)** - Create response analysis dataset for oncology efficacy endpoints.

### Occurrence Data Structure (OCCDS) Analysis Datasets

OCCDS datasets have one observation per subject per occurrence of an event, capturing multiple events per subject.

-   **[`ADAE` (Adverse Events Analysis)](adae.qmd)** - Build an analysis dataset for adverse events with derived variables for analysis and reporting.

### Time-to-Event Analysis Dataset (`ADTTE`)

-   **[`ADTTE` (Time-to-Event Analysis)](adtte.qmd)** - Develop oncology time-to-event analysis dataset for survival analyses, including censoring and event derivations.

### Pharmacokinetic Analysis Datasets

-   **[`ADPC` (Pharmacokinetic Concentrations)](adpc.qmd)** - Build pharmacokinetic concentration analysis dataset with timepoint derivations.
-   **[`ADPPK` (Population Pharmacokinetic)](adppk.qmd)** - Create population pharmacokinetic analysis dataset for modeling and simulation.

## Quick Reference

| Dataset Type | Example | Key Packages | Structure |

| **BDS - Vitals** | [`ADVS`](advs.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per parameter per timepoint |
| **BDS - Response** | [`ADRS`](adrs.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per parameter per timepoint |
| **OCCDS - Safety** | [`ADAE`](adae.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per event |
| **Time-to-Event** | [`ADTTE`](adtte.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per parameter |
| **PK Concentration** | [`ADPC`](adpc.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per timepoint per analyte |
| **Population PK** | [`ADPPK`](adppk.qmd) | admiral, metacore, metatools, xportr | One record per subject per timepoint |

## Workflow Overview

Each example demonstrates a consistent workflow for creating ADaM datasets:

1. **Data Input** - Load SDTM datasets and required metadata specifications
2. **Derivations** - Apply ADaM derivation functions to create analysis variables (e.g., baseline flags, change from baseline, derived parameters)
3. **Metadata Application** - Use metadata specifications to control dataset attributes, labels, and formats
4. **Validation** - Perform dataset checks and validation against specifications
5. **Export** - Create SAS transport files ready for regulatory submission

## Dataset Dependencies

Most ADaM datasets require `ADSL` as input for subject-level variables. The typical flow is:

**SDTM datasets** → **`ADSL`** → **Other ADaM datasets** → **TLGs**

## Key Packages Used

-   **[`{admiral}`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/)** - Core ADaM derivations and functions for creating analysis datasets following CDISC standards
-   **[`{metacore}`](https://atorus-research.github.io/metacore/)** - Metadata and specifications management, storing variable-level metadata
-   **[`{metatools}`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/metatools/)** - Dataset building and validation using metadata, applying specifications to datasets
-   **[`{xportr}`](https://atorus-research.github.io/xportr/)** - SAS transport file creation and eSub compliance checks for regulatory submissions

## Meet the `{admiral}` Family

The `{admiral}` ecosystem includes specialized extension packages for different therapeutic areas and study types:

-   **[Admiral Family Overview](https://pharmaverse.org/e2eclinical/adam/)** - Explore the complete admiral family
-   **Extension Packages** - These packages provide additional therapeutic area support, for example including functions for oncology endpoints such as RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors (`{admiralonco}`)
-   **Additional extensions** - Packages for other therapeutic areas are under development

Each extension package builds on `{admiral}` core functionality while providing domain-specific derivations.

## Common Derivations Across Examples

While each ADaM dataset has unique requirements, several derivation patterns appear across multiple examples:

- **Baseline derivations** - Identifying and flagging baseline records
- **Change from baseline** - Calculating analysis values relative to baseline
- **Analysis flags** - Creating indicators for analysis populations and key events
- **Date/time imputations** - Handling partial or missing dates
- **Treatment variables** - Deriving planned and actual treatment information
- **Parameter derivations** - Creating derived or calculated parameters

These common patterns are demonstrated throughout the examples, showing how `{admiral}` functions can be reused across different dataset types.
