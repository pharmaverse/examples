## Overview

This section showcases interactive applications and tools for exploring and analyzing clinical trial data. Interactive applications enable dynamic data exploration, real-time analysis updates, and enhanced collaboration among study teams.

The examples demonstrate how pharmaverse packages can be used to create sophisticated interactive experiences for clinical data analysis and reporting.

## Examples

The following interactive application examples are available:

### Interactive Data Exploration

- **[Teal Applications](teal.qmd)** - Explore the `{teal}` framework for building modular, interactive Shiny applications specifically designed for clinical trial data analysis. Teal provides a standardized approach to creating interactive apps that integrate multiple analysis modules, enabling efficient data exploration, visualization, and reporting.

## Benefits of Interactive Applications

Interactive applications provide several advantages for clinical trial analysis:

- **Dynamic Exploration** - Allow users to interactively filter, subset, and explore data without programming
- **Real-Time Updates** - See analysis results update instantly as parameters change
- **Reproducibility** - Maintain reproducible analyses while providing flexibility
- **Collaboration** - Enable statisticians, clinicians, and stakeholders to work together
- **Regulatory Review** - Facilitate reviewer exploration of study data and analyses

## Key Packages Used

- **`{teal}`** - Framework for building modular clinical trial Shiny applications
- **`{shiny}`** - Web application framework for R
- **Various pharmaverse packages** - Integrated for data processing and analysis

## Getting Started

The examples in this section may include interactive components that can be run locally or accessed through hosted applications. Follow the instructions in each example to set up and explore the interactive features.

These tools are particularly valuable for:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Safety monitoring
- Efficacy assessment
- Data review meetings
- Regulatory interactions
