## Overview

This section contains examples demonstrating the creation of Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) domains using pharmaverse packages. SDTM is a CDISC standard for organizing and formatting data to streamline the regulatory review process.

The examples in this section primarily utilize the `{sdtm.oak}` package along with other pharmaverse tools to transform raw clinical trial data into SDTM-compliant datasets.

## Examples

The following SDTM domain examples are available:

### Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

- **[DM (Demographics)](dm.qmd)** - Learn how to create a Demographics domain including subject-level information such as age, sex, race, and study participation dates.

### Clinical Events

- **[AE (Adverse Events)](ae.qmd)** - Create an Adverse Events domain to capture information about adverse events experienced by subjects during the study.

### Findings

- **[VS (Vital Signs)](vs.qmd)** - Build a Vital Signs domain to record measurements such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and other vital sign observations.

## Getting Started

Each example includes:

- Introduction and context
- Step-by-step programming workflow
- Code examples using pharmaverse packages
- Expected output and validation checks

All examples use raw datasets from `{pharmaverseraw}` as input, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

Before working with these examples, it's recommended to review the [`{sdtm.oak}` package documentation](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtm.oak/) to understand key concepts such as algorithms, oak_id_vars, and mapping functions.
